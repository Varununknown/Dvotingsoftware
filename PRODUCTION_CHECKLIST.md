# E-Voting System Production Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your E-Voting System is ready for production deployment.

## Security

- [ ] **MongoDB Atlas Security**
  - [ ] Use strong, unique passwords for database users
  - [ ] Configure IP whitelisting (restrict to application server IPs)
  - [ ] Enable network encryption
  - [ ] Use VPC peering if available in your cloud provider
  - [ ] Enable audit logging

- [ ] **Environment Variables**
  - [ ] Move all sensitive information to environment variables
  - [ ] Use different variables for development and production
  - [ ] Generate strong, unique secrets for SESSION_SECRET and JWT_SECRET
  - [ ] Store environment variables securely in your hosting platform

- [ ] **API Security**
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting for login/registration endpoints
  - [ ] Add CSRF protection for form submissions
  - [ ] Validate and sanitize all user input
  - [ ] Use parameterized queries for MongoDB operations
  - [ ] Set secure and httpOnly flags for cookies
  - [ ] Implement proper CORS settings

- [ ] **Frontend Security**
  - [ ] Sanitize HTML output to prevent XSS
  - [ ] Set appropriate Content-Security-Policy headers

  - [ ] Configure timeouts appropriately

- [ ] **Frontend Optimization**
  - [ ] Minify and bundle JavaScript and CSS
  - [ ] Optimize and compress images
  - [ ] Use lazy loading for non-critical resources
  - [ ] Implement code splitting
  - [ ] Use CDN for static assets in production

## Reliability

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Add global error handler in Express
  - [ ] Implement error boundaries in React
  - [ ] Set up error logging and monitoring
  - [ ] Create custom error pages (404, 500)

- [ ] **Logging**
  - [ ] Configure production logging (avoid verbose logs)
  - [ ] Set up log rotation
  - [ ] Use structured logging format
  - [ ] Implement centralized logging solution

- [ ] **Monitoring**
  - [ ] Set up health check endpoints
  - [ ] Configure uptime monitoring
  - [ ] Implement performance monitoring
  - [ ] Set up alerts for critical failures

- [ ] **Database**
  - [ ] Configure regular backups
  - [ ] Implement data redundancy
  - [ ] Test backup restoration process
  - [ ] Set up database monitoring

## Scaling

- [ ] **Application Scaling**
  - [ ] Ensure application is stateless
  - [ ] Configure load balancing (if needed)
  - [ ] Implement horizontal scaling strategy
  - [ ] Set up auto-scaling (if applicable)

- [ ] **Database Scaling**
  - [ ] Configure MongoDB Atlas tier appropriate for production load
  - [ ] Set up sharding if expecting high volume
  - [ ] Implement read replicas for read-heavy operations

## Deployment

- [ ] **CI/CD**
